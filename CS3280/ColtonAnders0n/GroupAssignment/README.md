CS3280 Magical Group Assignment

This is the repository for the group assignment. 

I created the required folders as well as their required contents. 

In the main folder, I just added the default main window that is created when you create a WPF app. 

I might have pushed some unnecessary parts of the project to Github, but at least everything is here- I think. haha 

There is a Github extension for Visual Studio, which is what I used to push the project.

Here's a helpful tutorial for using the Github extension, if you're interested:

There may be slight differences in the video vs. your current version of Visual studio.
